Theme:

Our main theme is comic book. We want the website to have a fun vibe and so, we will be using colors that are vibrant and bright.
We also want our page to have relevant images in the resources portion of the site. We will incorporate images of heroes on the 
footer and have an animation when the user hovers over it that will move the position of the hero towards the bottom of the footer
link and display a quote they said.
